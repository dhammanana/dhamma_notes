        - sotapanna exists in that group so buddha never use word moggapurisa. although sotapanna never talk about their attainment, others declare his attainment.
        - description:
            - Falsely claiming to have sublime attainments is an act that results in pārājika. 
            - Even if a bhikkhu does possess such sublime attainments, they must not be publicly mentioned. 
            - If a bhikkhu, states the sublime attainments he possesses to one who is anupasampannana such act will result in a dukkaṭa offense.
        - cases:
            - 1. If a bhikkhu directly states the sublime attainments he possesses to an anupasampanna, a pācittiya offense will be committed.
            - 2. If a bhikkhu indirectly states the sublime attainments he possesses to one that is not fully admitted, a dukkaṭa offense will be committed.
        - Important points
            1. Under this training rule the bhikkhuni must also be considered a upasampanna. Therefore, **it is fine for a monk to express his real sublime attainments to a bhikkhunī.** 
            2. If acquired sublime states are conveyed to a upasampanna, an offense will not occur.
            3. When being pestered and inquired repeatedly “Venerable Sir, what have you attained from practising the holy life?”, during the time of parinibbāna, or the time of passing or any other time, it is worthwhile to mention the attained sublime states to a upasampanna.
            4. It is worthy of mentioning the qualities related to learnedness and discipline even to an anupasampanna.
            5. Under instances of non-offenses; the sentences related to ummattaka, khittacitta and vedanatta were not declared because insanity and a bewildered state of mind cannot occur amongst ariya beings. If puthujjana jhānalabhīs happen to develop such mind-sets, their jhāna will immediately vanish.
        - Perception and Volition
            - The commentary indicates that this training rule is always broken in an acittaka manner. This is because those who have attained supramundane statuses (ariya puggala) will not deliberately go against the training rule. 
            - The moment a puthujjana monk, who possesses jhānas, intentionally attempts to break the training rule, his jhāna will vanish instantly. 
            - In any case, if a puthujjana monk, who possesses jhāna, deliberately breaks this training rule, by the time of breaching, he has already lost his jhāna. 
            - Therefore, this offense is always **acittaka**. The nature of being acittaka is **determined by knowing or not knowing the charter of this training rule**. As it is an acittaka offense, it is also categorised as nosaññāvimokkha.
        - Factors ↓ 
            - 1. Being sublime statuses that are actually possessed
2. Informing an anupasampanna
3. The anupasampanna knowing instantaneously what is being said
4. Expressing the idea directly

            - 4 **Mahābhūta (Four Great Elements)** 
                - **Paṭhavi dhātu (earth element)** 
                    - The {{hardness felt when an object is pressed}} is the paṭhavi dhātu (earth element)
                    - Softness is felt {{when certain objects are touched}}. 
                    - Such softness is nothing but a lesser amount of hardness. 
                    - The terms hardness and softness are used in comparison, just like smallness and largeness. 
                    - Something referred to as small is big when compared to something smaller. Similarly, what is referred to as large becomes small when compared with something bigger. In this manner, what is referred to as soft becomes hard when compared with something softer, and what is referred to as hard becomes soft when compared with something harder. Therefore, it should be understood that both hardness and softness refer to the earth element. The hardness felt by the human body is not very subtle. The subtle hardness in some objects cannot be felt by the humans. The term dhatu (element) implies that paṭhavi is a nature or an intrinsic characteristic and not a living being. Therefore, mere hardness, which is not a self or a being, is the paṭhavi dhātu.
                    - how softness and hardness both become roughness,... interchangeable?  #[[^^**fundamentals**^^ exam]] 
                - **Āpo dhātu (water element)** 
                    - water usually spread internally and externally in the corporealities that exist together.
                    - Objects with more earth element and less water element remain compact and hard.
                    - Bones, veins, flesh in bodies, as well as soil, rocks, iron, leaves, bark, roots, and wood, are things with less water element and more earth element.
                    - If there is less earth element and more water element, the object becomes fluid and starts to flow or spread over a surface. Oil and water are things with less paṭhavi and more āpo.
                - **Tejo dhātu (heat or cold element)** 
                    - Heat and coldness are the tejo dhātu. 
                    - The tejo dhātu **matures and ripens the co-existing rūpas**.
                    - In the beginning, animate and inanimate objects become stronger due to the maturing caused by tejo. Some of them even grow. 
                    - how tejo strengthen and weaken between kalāpa?
                    - After reaching the culmination of growth, further maturing of these physical bodies results in their decaying and deterioration. 
                    - The same tejo dhātu causes the development as well as the decay of various objects. Fire has a significant amount of the tejo dhātu.
                    - points:
                        - apo is heavier, tejo is lighter, vayo is support
                        - ruppana describe by ven ananda:
                            - gattīyati, pīḷiyati, kuppati : struck, oppress, change
            - 5 **Pasādarūpa: ** sensitivity rūpa
                - Living beings possess a **strong craving for perceiving beautiful objects**, hearing pleasant sounds, smelling pleasant odors, tasting enjoyable flavors, and experiencing physical contact. The kamma (action) that gives rise to life is connected with such craving. Consequently, when a being is born, the rebirth kamma associated with these desires **produces the necessary faculties for experiencing these desired objects**. Pasāda rūpas refer to these faculties present in the bodies of living beings that aid in experiencing physical objects. The term "**pasāda" denotes the clarity of a physical surface**, much like the surface of a mirror. In English, it is generally translated as "sensitivity."
                - 5 pasāda:
                    - cakkhuppasāda ⇒ vaṇṇa (rūparammaṇa) ⇒ vīthi
                        - even he see the same thing whole life, he still wants to see. the desire to see.
                        - if we satisfy the desire, desire will produce new life.?
                        - craving for living force kamma to produce sensitivity, to sense object, produce vīthi
                        - Daṭṭhukāmatā nidāna kammaja bhūtappasāda lakkhaṇa cakkhuṇa→initiate by desire to see, borne by kamma, bhūta sensitivity produced.
                        - where and how big is it?→It is situated in the **center of the pupil of the eye**, occupying an area approximately the s**ize of a louse's head **or, according to another ancient teacher, about the size of **half a green gram seed**.
                    - sotappasāda ⇒ sadda (saddarammaṇa) ⇒ vīthi
                        - where and how big?→The sensitivity **situated in the ear** that facilitates the perception of sounds is referred to as sotappasāda. It is situated in an **area shaped like a ring with copper-colored hair** (body hair/loma). 
                        - When sound waves impinge upon it, ear consciousness arises. This arising of ear consciousness is referred to as hearing. Unlike cakkhuppasāda, sotappasāda is exclusively receptive (dễ tiếp thu) to the images of sounds and not the images of visible forms.
                    - ghānappasāda ⇒ gandha (gandharammaṇa) ⇒ vīthi
                        - where and shape→The sensitivity located in the nose that **enables the perception of good and bad odors** is known as ghānappasāda. It is situated in an area **shaped like a goat's hoof** within the nose.
                        - The nose consciousness, responsible for recognizing odors, arises depending on ghānappasāda.
                    - jīvappasāda ⇒ rasa (rasarammaṇa) ⇒ vīthi
                        - The sensitivity found in the tongue that facilitates the **perception of flavors is referred to **as jivhāppasāda. It is located at a place resembling the edge of a water lily petal on the tongue. Tongue consciousness arises when **food and drinks come into contact with it,** allowing for the perception of taste.
                    - kāyappasāda ⇒ phoṭṭabba (phoṭṭabbarammaṇa) ⇒ vīthi
                        - The sensitivity present throughout the body that enables the perception of physical contact is known as kāyappasāda. It is **spread across the entire body**, **excluding areas such as head hair, body hair, nails, and dry skin**. When an object touches the body, kāyaviññāṇa (body consciousness) arises at the point of contact, perceiving the earth, fire, or air elements of the object. Internal bodily pains occur as a result of the internal organs impacting each other.

                - Five Sense Objects / Objective Material Phenomena
                    - are also **referred to as visaya rūpas** as they are captured by the previously explained five sensitivities.
                    - Rūpa / Vaṇṇa (Color)
                        - impacts the eye sensitivity and is perceived with the help of eye sensitivity.
                        - All corporealities are called rūpa because they are subject to change due to factors such as cold, heat, and others.
                        - The element of color is called rūpa because it can be seen. Among the twenty-eight corporealities, only the corporeality of color is visible. Other corporealities cannot be seen with the eyes.
                        - Only the corporeality of color impacts the eye sensitivity. What is felt by the hand cannot be seen by the eyes. Only color can be seen with the eyes. 
                        - In the doctrine of aggregates, rūpakkhanda encompasses all 28 rūpas. However, in the category of gocara rūpas, the **term rūpa specifically signifies the color that is sensitive to cakkhuppasāda**. Color, referred to as rūpa or vaṇṇa, belongs to the rūpakkhandha as it is also a form of matter under the broader context of materiality.
                    - Sadda (Sound)
                        - is the corporeality that impacts the ear sensitivity and is recognized with the help of ear sensitivity. 
                        - It arises when **physical objects collide or explode** (when objects that are attached to each other separate). Sadda **disappears as soon as it arises**. Its quick disappearance does not imply that its lifespan is shorter than that of other corporealities. Instead, it **means that the generation of sounds does not last for a long period.** 
                        - 3 ideas how we sense sound:
                            - ancient: sound travel to ear, sound generations should strong enough to come to the ear.
                            - buddhaghosa: reject and say that ear immediately sense sound, so he could know the direction
                            - Ledisayada: sound come to range distant to the ear that could sense.
                    - Gandha (Odor)
                        - The corporeality that impacts the nose sensitivity and is recognized with the help of the nose sensitivity is called gandha (smell/odor). 
                        - It is **abundant in some objects, while gandha in some objects is very subtle**. Although odor is present to some extent in all objects that are made of four great elements, the odor in some objects may not be noticeable due to its subtlety.
                    - Rasa (Taste)
                        - Taste is the corporeality that impacts the tongue sensitivity and is experienced with the help of the tongue sensitivity. It varies according to the primary elements. 
                        - Although taste exists in all objects, the taste of some objects may not be perceivable because those objects do not dissolve in saliva. Subtle taste in some objects may also not be felt. 
                        - In order to perceive taste, the object must dissolve and its taste must impact the tongue sensitivity.
                    - Phoṭṭhabba (Tangible Element)
                        - Phoṭṭhabba is the corporeality that impacts the body sensitivity and is recognized with the help of the body sensitivity. 
                        - It is not a separate element like rūpa, sadda, gandha, and rasa. 
                        - Only the three primary elements, **paṭhavi, tejo, and vāyo**, come into contact with kāyappasāda. The hardness perceived by the body is the paṭhavi dhātu. The sensations of coldness and heat experienced by the body are the tejo dhātu. The sensations of movement and pressure felt by the body are the vāyo dhātu. The water element does not come into contact with the kāyappasāda.
                        - even 3 element impact at the same time, only one could perceive at 1 time.
                        - because āpo (cohesion) hold inward kalāpa so cannot feel it. what about other āpo inter-connecting.?
                        - In the lesson on gocara rūpas, it is necessary to include the corporealities captured by all five sensitivities. Therefore, the three primary elements captured by the body sensitivity are named as phoṭṭhabba rūpa. However, when counting corporealities, phoṭṭhabba rūpa is not considered a separate reality.
            - **2 Bhāva** 
                - 
                - appearance decided by:
                    - Pali:
                        - liṅganti padhānaṅgabhūtaṃ mahāsaṇṭhānaṃ. 
                        - nimittanti paccaṅgabhūtaṃ khuddakasaṇṭhānaṃ. 
                        - kuttanti kīḷālilādi kriyāviseso. 
                        - ākappoti gamanādiko ākāravikāro.
                    - Liṅga: big marks
                    - nimitta: small marks
                    - kutta→nt. **behaviour, coquetry** [√kar] 
                    - ākappa→masc. **deportment; conduct; behaviour** [ā + √kapp + a] 
                - Bhāvarūpa form utuja rupa around to form a body appearance.
                - In brahma realm, sensual desire suppressed, so kamma don't produce bhāvarūpa.
                - when practice jhana need to have wisdom means to understand the danger of sensual desire.
                - 
            - **Hadaya** 
                - The five pasāda rūpas serve as the bases for the arising of **dvipañca viññāṇa**. For the remaining consciousnesses, the hadayavatthu is the base. It is located within the blood inside the heart muscle.
                - Kamma:
                    - bhāvataṇha: could not suppress, could only alter.
                    - rūpataṇha: if supressed , will reborn in arupa realm
                    - nāmataṇha: if supressed , will reborn in asañña realm
                    - kamma could not produce Nāma, so it only produce base for that.

            - **Jīvitindriya**
                - 
                - Additional Knowledge:
                    - Kammajarūpa only produced by kamma in **past lives** 
                    - in order for kammaja rupa to sustain, it need supports from jīvitindriya.
                    - citta ⇒ cittajarūpa. cittaja produced acrroding by vīthi, it cannot last longer than time of vīthi (17 cittakhaṇa)
                    - utuja similar, after afew moment after cause ended, utuja rūpa cannot generate new generation.
                    - ojārūpa is similar.
                    - 2 approaches:
                        1. all rupas generated accroding causes.
                        2. all rūpa generated because support of Jīvitindriya? only kammaja
                - 
                - Jīvitindriya rūpa (life faculty/life vitality)
                    - The corporeality that protects and sustains the generation of rūpas associated with it is known as jīvitindriya. Corporealities in the bodies of living beings arise due to four causes: kamma, citta, utu (tejo dhātu), and āhāra (nutriment). 
                    - **Among these four causes, citta, utu, and āhāra produce their respective rūpas while they are present.** Therefore, no additional special reality is required to protect the rūpas produced by these three causes (here, "protecting" (anupālana) means providing support for their continued generation). 
                    - On the other hand, kammajarūpas are produced by a cetanā (kamma) that has arisen and passed away. As a result, kammajarūpas require a special reality to protect and sustain their generation. The rūpa jīvitindriya fulfills this role by supporting the generation of kammajarūpas, enabling them to last for years.
                    - Jīvitindriya support for ↓ 
                        - support rupa to exist within 17 mind moment.
                        - support futher santati linage.
            - **Ojā** 
                - lakkhanacatuka:
                    - Lakhhaṇa
                    - Rasa
                        - Kicca: Function
                        - Sampatti: Accomplishment
                    - Paccupaṭṭhāna
                        - Upaṭṭhānākāra: manifestation
                        - Phala:
                    - Padaṭṭhāna: Near cause.
                - Cause for Ojā:
                    - normally body get support from other internal tejo and external tejo.
                    - jīvitindriya supports entire body of living body because it is fundamental.
                    - To support āhāraja rupa, kammaja rūpa (jīvitindriya) also support.
                    - other support is Kamma.
                - definition→Āhāra rūpa or ojā refers to the nutriment found in edible food.
                - eg of devouring an animal:
                    - Even consume all 4 kind of rūpa, only utuja rūpa is digest.
                    - among utuja rupa, some become urine, excrement, utuja, only some become Rasadhātu - essence extracted by digestion.
