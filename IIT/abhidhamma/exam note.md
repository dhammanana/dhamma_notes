10 anipphanna rūpa.
1. Ākāsadhātu – gap between two rūpa kalāpas or the border of a rūpakalāpa which differentiates it from another kalāpa.
2. Kāyaviññatti – Bodily intimation.
3. Vacīviññatti – Verbal intimation.
4. **Rūpassa**lahutā – Lightness of the four great elements.
5. Rūpassamudutā – Malleability of the four great elements.
6. Rūpassakammaññatā – Wieldiness of the four great elements.
7. Upacaya – Initial genesis of matter in a material process.
8. Santati – Repeated genesis of matter in a material process.
9. Jaratā – Aging or maturation of matter.
10. Aniccatā – Breaking up or vanishing of matter.

### 2. pathavī, Tejo, explains how pathavī hardness softness. how tejo it can strengthen, and weaken kalāpa
Paṭhavī:
- paṭhavī dhātu is hardness felt when pressing the object. 
- Softness is felt when an object is touched.
- softness is nothing but a lesser amount of hardness. So, it is used for a mere comparison purpose.
Tejo:
- Heat and coldness are the tejo dhātu.
- beginning, tejo supports animate and inanimate objects to be stronger due to maturing causes, after reaching the peak of development, it causes objects to decay.

### 3. p5, 2nd paragraph, how pasāda produce,  kamma, taṇhā,  pasāda. eg. Explain causes of pasāda, relationship taṇha, kamma,  pasāda.  (most important)
- Living beings possess a strong craving for perceiving beautiful objects in 5 doors.
- Kamma that gives rise to life is connected with those cravings.
- consequently, rebirth kamma associated with these desires produces the necessary faculties for experiencing these desired objects.
### 4. p7. sadda (sound), phoṭṭhabba. eg. What is phoṭṭhabba, and why does āpo not exist there?
sadda: sound
- **intro**: it is a corporeality that impacts the ear sensitivity.
- **how it produced**: it arises when physical objects collide or explode.
- **how it lasts**: it disappears as soon as it arises because its generation doesn't last long.
Phoṭṭhabba:
- **intro**: Rūpa that impacts the bodily sensitivity.
- **3elms**: Only 3 elements: paṭhavī, tejo, vāyo come into contact with kāyapasāda to perceive hardness, heat, and movement.
- **why not āpo**:Āpo doesn't come into contact with the kāyapasāda. because āpo (cohesion) holds inward kalāpa so cannot feel it.
- phoṭṭhabba is being counted in gocara, but not in counting the number of rūpa.
### 5. p9. bhāva, jīvitindriya.
##### Bhāvarūpa: 5 points.
- **Introduction**: Bhāvarūpa encompasses the corporeality associated with sex. that is itthibhāva, pumbhāva.
- **influence**: these bhāvarūpa influence the characteristics of masculinity and femininity in the bodies of living beings.
- **alternative term**: they are also referred to as \*indriya highlighting the influences on the respective genders.
- **Origin**: bhāvarūpa together with hadaya, jīvitindriya arise simultaneously in paṭisandhi citta.
- **Widespread**: bhāvarūpas are not confined to a specific area but are present throughout the entire body.
##### Jīvitindriya: 5 points. 
- **Introduction**: They play a crucial role in protecting and sustaining the generation of associated rūpa.
- **3 causes no need to be protected**: out of 4 causes of arising rūpa - kamma, citta, utu, āhāra, the last 3 can produce their respective rūpa while they present, so they don't need to be protected.
- **kamma cause**: kammaja, produced by cetana (kamma) that has arisen and passed away, requires a special reality to protect and sustain their generation.
- **Protecting**: anupālana means providing support for their continued generation.
- **Role**: Jīvitindriya fulfills the role of supporting generations, allowing them to last for years.

### 6. p11. 2 viññatti, lakkhaṇarūpa, lifespan of each rūpa.
**vikārarūpa (modes or modifications):** 5
- **intro**: encompasses special modes or manifestations of concretely produced matter.
- **types**: 2 types of viññatti (intimation), lahutā (lightness), mudutā (malleable), and kammaññatā (adaptability)

**kāyaviññatti:**
- 1. **Intro**: Kāyaviññatti is **the force or power** responsible for **directing** the cittakiriya vāyo dhātu, associated with bodily movements, based on the intentions of the mind.
2. **Process:** When intention arises, that power causes vāyo dhātu to arise in the intended limb, called cittakiriya vāyo dhātu.

**Vacīviññatti (verbal intimation)**:
- **intro:** is the force or power that governs sound, and shapes it into letters, words meant for verbal expression.
- **process**: Sound that arises when cittaja vāyo strikes certain places in the vocal area, is modified according to mind's intention by vaciviññatti.
- **purpose**: express the intention of the being in whom they arise.

**Rūpassa lahutā, rūpassa mudutā, and rūpassa kammaññatā**
- **Lahutā** refers to the _lightness of the four great elements_ and is the opposite of heaviness. 
- **Mudutā** denotes the **malleability** of the four great elements and is the opposite of stiffness. 
- **Kammaññatā** represents the **adaptability** of the four great elements, making them suitable for work.
- With their arising, the body can be moved swiftly and smoothly and becomes adaptable to work.

**Lifespan of each rūpa:**
1. 2 viññatti: 1 cittakkhaṇa (mind-moment) = 3 anucittakkhaṇa
2. upacaya, santati, aniccatā: 1 anu
3. jaratā: 49 anu
4. remain 22 rūpa: 17 cittakkhaṇa.

### 8. 6.8. cittaja, physical and verbal action in maintaining posture.
**citta**ja:
- **ability**: 75 cittas can produce cittajarūpa: except arūpa-vipāka, dvipañca-viññāṇa. **paṭisadhi and cuti of arahants are also substitutions here**.
- **phrase**: citta produce cittaja during its genesis. (persisting and dissolving moment is too weak)
- **exclusion**: cittas arise in arūpa realms cannot produce cittajarūpa.
- **time frame**: cittaja starts to arise from the first bhavaṅga after paṭisandhi to mind-moment before cuti.

 1. saṃsedaja and Opapātika
	![[samsedaja 2024-01-16 15.53.13.excalidraw]]
Notes:
- Those beings in the kāma realm who did not obtain cakkhu dasaka kalāpa are called **andha**. 
- Those who did not obtain sota dasaka kalāpa are called **badhira**.
- Those who did not obtain ghāna dasaka kalāpa are called **aghānaka**.
- Those who did not obtain bhāva dasaka kalāpa are called **napuṃsaka**.

saṃsedaja

| duggati | suggati |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ahetu | ahetuka | dvi,tihetuka |

> [!Quote]- From book
>	1. Cakkhu, sota, ghāna, jivhā, kāya, bhāva (only one), and vatthu dasaka kalāpas arise in saṃsedaja and opapātika beings of the kāma realm at the moment of rebirth (paṭisandhi).
>	2. On some occasions, they may not acquire certain indriyas (faculties) from paṭisandhi, such as cakkhu, sota, ghāna, and bhāva dasaka kalāpas. The deficiencies of faculties in saṃsedaja and opapātika beings in the kāma realm can be understood as follows: 
>		 a. Duggati ahetuka and sugati ahetuka saṃsedaja beings may not obtain caies.
>		b. Some duggati opapātikas do not acquire cakkhu, sota, and bhāva dasaka kalāpas. It is mentioned that there are no opapātika beings in the kāma realm without the ghāna dasaka kalāpa.
>	3.Sugati opapātikas acquire all faculties by birth. They do not have any deficiencies in faculties. Opapātika humans born at the beginning of a kappa (ādikappika manussā) do not have the bhāva dasaka kalāpa by birth. However, this is not considered a deficiency caused by weak paṭisandhi kamma or hindrance from past akusala.

### 13. 6.14: whole. p30
It is also important to classify the rūpas in each realm.

|#|Realm|Rūpas that airse in the realm|
|---|---|---|
|1|Kāma bhūmi|All 28 rūpas|
|2|Ordinary rūpa bhūmi|23 rūpas except ghānappasāda, jivhāppasāda, kāyappasāda and 2 bhāvarūpas,|

### 14. difference between āhāra, āhāraja, utu, utujarūpa

āhāra / āhārarūpa is the ojā (nutritive essence, nutrient) present in every rūpakalāpa
āhārajarūpa is the rūpa produced by ojā with the support of another ojā in the body
āhārajakalāpa is the rūpakalāpa produced by ojā which can be of two kinds (ojāaṭṭhamakakalāpa or lahutādiekādasakakalāpa)

utu is the tejodhātu (heat and cold) present in every kalāpa
utuja rūpa is the rūpa produced by tejo / utu
utuja kalāpa is the rūpakalāpa produced by tejo which can be of 4 kinds (ojāaṭṭhamakakalāpa, saddanavaka, lahutādiekādasaka or saddalahutādidvādasaka)
