There are four lakkhaṇa rūpas: upacaya, santati, jaratā, and aniccatā. 
The terms **upacaya and santati signify the genesis or arising of matter**. Upacaya refers *to the arising of matter in an animate body* before all types of rūpas that are supposed to arise in that body have appeared. Once all types of rūpas have arisen in an animate body, the generation of those rūpas continues. In this generation, **new rūpas arise in the place of vanishing rūpas, and this process is known as santati.** **Jaratā** refers to the **decaying** of corporealities, while aniccatā represents their breakup or vanishing.

These four lakkhaṇa rūpas are called so because they are mere characteristics or universal attributes of other corporealities.

The ten corporealities comprising ākāsa dhātu, five vikāra rūpa, and the four lakkhaṇa rūpas are called anipphanna rūpas because they are not directly produced by the four major causes of matter nor do they arise directly from them.

dhammasaṅghani:
first  arising is called ācaya
stage of arising is called upacaya.
both of them are also called upacaya.
all of the stages can be called jāti
