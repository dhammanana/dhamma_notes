#### 2 viññatti
- physical intimation kāyaviññatti
- verbal intimation vaciviññatti
Based on viññatti we can know what is the meaning of gesture or action without questioning.
when the mind has the intention to move the hand, it will create cittajarūpa together with kāyaviññatti of that moving in vāyo and infuse it into limbs to have that movement.
**Kāyaviññatti (bodily intimation)**
> Kāyaviññatti is the force or power that directs or steers the cittakiriya vāyo dhātu (the wind element associated with bodily movements) according to the intention of the mind (cetanā) to perform relevant bodily actions. 
> When the intention arises to perform a physical action, the power of that intention causes the vāyo dhātu to arise in the intended limb. 
> This newly arisen air element is called cittakiriya vāyo dhātu, and it facilitates the movement of the body or limb. Kāyaviññatti arises together with this vāyo dhātu and steers it according to the mind's intention. 
> Bodily movements occur according to the desires of beings due to kāyaviññatti.

>- force or power

**Vacīviññatti** (verbal intimation)
voice comes from the lung and vibrates the vocal cords.
>Vacīviññatti is the **force or power that controls sound** in a way that creates letters and words intended to be uttered. 
>Sound arises when the cittaja vāyo (mind-produced wind element) strikes certain places in the vocal area. 
>The sound that arises is then modified according to the mind's intention by the vacīviññatti.

> - cittaja vāyo strike in the vocal area.

 
2 diffrient opinions:
	1. commentary: vacīviññatti causes striking and makes the sound.
	2. paramatthadīpanī: kāyaviññatti cause striking, after striking create vacīviññatti, consciousness takes control over newly produced rūpa

These two rūpas (kāyaviññatti and vacīviññatti) are called viññatti as they express the intentions of the being in whom they arise.

upādinnaka:
	1. kammajarūpa
	lokiya citta cetasika
	2. any reality that is considered part of the self. 
	so, it will not contain head hair, dry-skin, ... because kammajarupa does not exist there.
#### 3 Lahutādi
Rūpassa lahutā, rūpassa mudutā, and rūpassa kammaññatā
lightness, malleability, and wieldiness.
1. Lahutā refers to the **lightness** of the four great elements and is the opposite of heaviness. less _earth, āpo element_
2. Mudutā denotes the **malleability** of the four great elements and is the opposite of stiffness. _less paṭhavī_
3. Kammaññatā represents the **adaptability** of the four great elements, making them suitable for work. _less vāyo_
these are unique in the living body.

>[!summary] Lahutādi
>- lahutā: lightness of 4 elements. esp. pathavī, āpo
>- mudutā: malleability (# stiffness). esp. less pathavī
>- kamaññatā: wieldiness, adaptability.

because of these, we might think of a self-acting inside.
uaṇṭhāṇa: **shape** when a group of kalapa works interacting with each other.
