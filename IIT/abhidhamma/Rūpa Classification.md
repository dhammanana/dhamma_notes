1. **ajjhattika**: 5 pasāda, *citta*.
2. **vatthu**: viññāṇa & kilesa. 5 pasāda + hadaya.
3. **dvāra**: viññāṇadvāra: 5 pasāda, *citta*. kammadvāra: kāyaviññatti, vacīviññatti, **javana** (33citta).
4. **indriya**: 
### 1. Ajjhattika rūpa and Bāhira rūpa
I, myself | bahiddha anything else, different with bāhira.
- kamaja rūpa and citta are to ajjhattika here.
	in kammaja rūpa, attachment to 5 pasāda is more prominent.
- bāhira here is referred to 52 cetasika, anything else other than ajjjattika. 23 rūpas other than 5 pasādas)

### 2. Vatthu rūpa and Avatthu rūpa
two types of vatthu: **viññāṇa vatthu** and **kilesa vatthu**.
viññāṇavatthu is mentioned here:
- Realities that serve as the basis for mental phenomena to arise are called viññāṇa vatthu or vatthu rūpas.
- six vatthu rūpas: the **five pasāda rūpas and hadayavatthu** rūpa.
- The remaining twenty-two rūpas are called avatthu rūpa

### 3. Dvāra rūpa and Advāra rūpa
Two types of dvāra: 
- **viññāṇadvāra** - 6 dvāra (door for consciousness to cognize an object) place of striking, when object strike in those dvāra, vīthi arose.
	- 5 pasāda
	- citta.
- **kammadvāra** (door for actions to be performed). **instrument** to perform kamma.
	- kāyaviññatti
	- vācīviññatti
	- javanacitta (kusala & akusala javana) 12 akusala + 21 kusala. (8mahagga + 5rūpa + 4arūpa + 4magga)
	should understand here, viññatti plays an important role in doing kamma.
- five pasāda rūpas are considered viññāṇa dvāra, and two viññatti rūpas are considered kamma dvāra. 
- The remaining twenty-one rūpas (other than the seven dvārarūpas) are classified as **advāra rūpa.**

### 4. Indriya rūpa and Anindriya rūpa
inda + iya.
There are eight indriya rūpas in total. 
- **The five pasāda** rūpas dominate over their corresponding sense consciousnesses in the acts of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling touch, respectively.
- **Two bhāva** rūpas dominate all other rūpas in animate bodies, shaping them to be masculine or feminine.
- **Jīvitindriya** rūpa is an indriya for kammaja rūpas to **sustain in generations without their cause**, the kamma.

### 5. Sappaṭigha rūpa and Appaṭigha rūpa
- 5 pasāda + 7 gocara rūpa **clash against each other**. = 12
- total: the five pasāda rūpas, vaṇṇa rūpa, sadda rūpa, gandha rūpa, rasa rūpa, paṭhavi, tejo, and vāyo. *(8-āpo)* 
- remain 16 from āpo is not easy to know (dūre) because they do not clash with each other, which is called appaṭigha.

### 6. Oḷārika rūpa and Sukhuma rūpa
>same as sappṭigha and appaṭigha.

The **twelve** sappaṭigha rūpas that clash with other rūpas are also called oḷārika rūpa (gross matter). 
The remaining **sixteen** rūpas that do not clash with other rūpas are called sukhuma rūpa (subtle matter).
### 7. Santike rūpa and Dūre rūpa
**Oḷārika rūpas can be easily known,** so they are considered close – santike rūpa. **Even they are located far** from the observer, they are still considered close due to their ease of cognition. Sukhuma rūpas, on the other hand, cannot be easily known like oḷārika rūpas, hence they are considered far – dūre rīpa - even though they exist in the body of the observer.

### 8. Upādinna rūpa and Anupādinna rūpa
- **Eighteen kamma-born matters are called upādinna rūpa**. 
	- 8 avinibbhoga
	- 8 indriya
	- 1  hadaya
	- 1 ākāsa.
- The remaining ten are called anupādinna rūpa. 
- The term upādinna implies things that are strongly clung to as "I" and "mine" with diṭṭhi and taṇhā. 
- Generally, all rūpas in an animate body are considered as such by the being who possesses them. Among all rūpas in animate bodies, kammaja rūpas are the most significant. Therefore, the attachment towards them is stronger compared to other corporealities. Hence, they are called upādinna.
**32 lokiya vipākacitta and 35 cetasika (- virati) is also call upādinna**

### 9. Sanidassana rūpa and Anidassana rūpa
**Vaṇṇa rūpa (color) is called sanidassana** rūpa since it **can be seen** with eye consciousness. 
All the other twenty-seven rūpas are called anidassana rūpa as they cannot be seen with cakkhuviññāṇa.

### 10. Gocaraggāhika rūpa and Agocaraggāhika rūpa
The **five pasāda rūpas are called gocaraggāhika** since they take their corresponding sense objects. 
It is important to note that the phrase **==“taking objects”== does not mean that the five pasāda rūpas have cognitive ability.** They are sensitive to the corresponding sense objects and facilitate the cognition of those objects by their respective sense consciousnesses. 
The remaining twenty-three rūpas are considered as agocarggāhika as they are not sensitive to objects like the five pasāda.

> object (vaṇṇa, sadda, gandha, rasa, phoṭṭhabba) reach (sampatta) door (cakkhu, sota, ghāna, jivha, kāya) 
> sampatta is decided by need to touch to sense or not.

Gocaraggāhika rūpa can be further divided into **sampatta**gocaraggāhika and asampattagocaraggāhika. Among the five pasāda rūpas, ghānappasāda, jivhāppasāda, and kāyappasāda are respectively sensitive to gandha, rasa, and poṭṭhabba of rūpakalāpas that have **arisen physically touching them**. So, they are called sampattagocaraggāhika. On the other hand, cakkhuppasāda and sotappasāda are respectively sensitive to vaṇṇa and sadda of rūpakalāpas that have arisen without physically touching them, hence called asampattagocaraggāhika.

### 11. Vinibbhoga rūpa and Avinibbhoga rūpa
need to exist in every rūpa.
**Eight rūpas - paṭhavi, āpo, tejo, vāyo, vaṇṇa, gandha, rasa, and ojā - always arise together.** Whenever a rūpa kalāpa arises, these eight are always found together. Hence, they are **inseparable - avinibbhoga**. The remaining twenty rūpas are vinibbhoga, meaning they are not found in every kalāpa as avinibbhoga rūpas does.

These categorizations help in understanding the different classifications of rūpas within the Abhidhamma framework.

<sup>according to mūlaṭīka, in the Brahma realm, only vaṇṇa exists (gandha, rasa, ojā doesn't exist)</sup>
