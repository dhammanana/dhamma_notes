what do you say brother, you are received by me like mom after our mother died, like dad after father died, in your house you are wealthy, it is  possible to  do merit while living in household, don't do so. Dear brother, having heard the dhamma-talk of the buddha, I'm unable to live in household. Having gained clear insight of the very gentle subtle of three characteristic **by** the blessed one, he preached the dhamma that is beautiful in the beginning, middle, and the end, It is impossible for one to fulfill  by living in household, I will ordain, dear brother.
