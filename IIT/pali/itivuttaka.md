- Whoever having knows all from every aspect, is not attached from all things (meaning), 

**anabhijānaṃ**:: (fr. present particle abhijānanta) without knowing well.

kattu: kar + tar > kattu (rt>tt): one who does.
vattā: vad + tu > vattu: one who say.
upetā: endowed with

not perfectly knowing māna, they come to existence again.
>"mānupetā ayaṃ pajā, mānaganthā bhave ratā,
>mānaṃ aparijānantā, āgantāro punabbhavaṃ.

# 4. Avijjānīvaraṇasuttaṃ

I haven't seen with wisdom any other even (pi) one hindrance, after concealing their hindrance, people run and wander for a long time like this, avijjānīvaraṇaṃ. 
avijjānīvaraṇaṃ is indeed, bhikkhu, people having conceal, run and wander for long time
>"nāhaṃ, bhikkhave, aññaṃ ekanīvaraṇampi samanupassāmi yena nīvaraṇena nivutā pajā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsaranti yathayidaṃ, bhikkhave, avijjānīvaraṇaṃ . avijjānīvaraṇena hi, bhikkhave, nivutā pajā dīgharattaṃ sandhāvanti saṃsarantī"ti. etamatthaṃ bhagavā avoca. tatthetaṃ iti vuccati –

after  some letter, ta prefix change to ṭa,
eg, vivuṭa = vivuta
āhaṭa=āhata.
vivuta=vivuṭa
sandhāvanti:: transmigrate, follow the road. (saṃ + dhāv)

no other, even one dhamma, people conceal this
wander, long time, like hiding moha
and who having destroyed delusion, mass of darkness 
they don't wander again, those cause is not exists,

>"natthañño ekadhammopi, yenevaṃ nivutā pajā,
>saṃsaranti ahorattaṃ, yathā mohena āvutā.
>"ye ca mohaṃ pahantvāna, tamokhandhaṃ padālayuṃ,
>na te puna saṃsaranti, hetu tesaṃ na vijjatī"ti.

āvuta = nivuta.

3. karaṇa: ins
4. sampadana: dat
5. apādana: gen
6. adhikaraṇa: abl
7. bhāva: kar+tuṃ, gamaṇa

>"taṇhādutiyo puriso, dīghamaddhāna saṃsaraṃ,
>itthabhāvaññathābhāvaṃ , saṃsāraṃ nātivattati.

taṇhā dutiyā yassa (aññāpada) taṇhadutiyo -> bahubbīhi.

sandhi and samāsa is differentiated by: sandhi is only join with 2 words, samāsa is join with the same vibhatti.
ima + thaṃ > itthaṃ :: thus
aññathā: other maner.
sambhavaṃ:: origin, birth
paribbaje:: pari+vaj > opt. paribbajati wander.

having known the danger of this, craving is the cause of suffering.
craving is abandoned(vīta), having non-attachment, having mindfulness, bhikkhu should wander.
>"etamādīnavaṃ ñatvā, taṇhaṃ dukkhassa sambhavaṃ,
>vītataṇho anādāno, sato bhikkhu paribbaje"ti.
