**duṭṭhulla:** pārājika, saṅghadisesa
**aduṭṭhulla:** others.

Who, where, and how: Venerable Upananda in Sāvatthi was in a quarrel with the Chabbaggiya monks
if saṅgha do vinayakamma sammuti, it is not wrong to announce to anupasampanna.
**Important points**
1. An offense will be committed under this training rule if the subject (vatthu) and offense (āpatti) are both stated to those who are not fully admitted. That is stating “A particular bhikkhu deliberately committed a saṅghadisesa offense (stating the āpatti) by releasing sperm (stating the vatthu)” etc. *It must be known that an offense will not be committed if only the subject or the offense is stated.*
2. If non-grave offenses (**aduṭṭhullāpatti**) are stated to anupasampannas, a **dukkaṭa** offense will be committed.
3. If the training rules **broken by sāmaṇeras are also stated to anupasampannas, a dukkaṭa** offense will be committed.

**Perception and Volition**

perceptions are duṭṭhullāpatti-saññā and aduṭṭhullāpatti-saññā.
