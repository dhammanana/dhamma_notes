### explain in  brief:
#### **amisadānaṅga**: **p6**
>Tattha sānusayasantānavato paresaṃ pūjānuggahakāmatāya attano vijjamānavatthupariccajanavasappavattacetanā dānaṃ nāma.

1. The thing being offered should belong to the donor and must be existing.
2. The offering should be made to someone else (other than the donor) either with the intention of supporting or honoring the receiver.

#### **āmisa dāna cetana**:
The volition by which āmisa dāna is performed is called āmisa dāna cetanā (dāna cetanā). It is the cetanā cetasika by which relevant mental, verbal and physical acts are performed in dāna. It is threefold as follows.
1. Pubba cetanā – volitions by which one plans and gets ready to make a donation.
2. Muñcana cetanā – volitions by which one makes the donation.
3. Apara cetanā – volitions involved with the donation after the donation was made.

#### **Āmisa dāna cittuppāda**:
Cittuppāda involved in āmisa dāna means all the consciousnesses and mental factors that arise while making a donation. Out of them, the cetanā is the foremost and we have already discussed about it. State of the mind and attitudes of the donor also hugely matters in a donation, especially deciding its superiority and inferiority. State of the mind and attitudes of a person are manifested in his mentalities. In this lesson, we shall discuss about the state of mind and attitudes of the donor under the term āmisa dāna cittuppāda.Cittuppāda involved in āmisa dāna means all the consciousnesses and mental factors that arise while making a donation.

#### **kāyamaya dāna**
 (a dāna which is a kāyakamma)
A donation made with one’s own hand (involving any body part) is called kāyamayadāna. Such types of donations are seen when devotees offer food to monks who have come to collect alms to their houses and while giving money to beggars on the roads with their hands.

#### **Vacīmayadāna (a dāna which is a vacīkamma)**
A donation made by merely instruction is called vacīmayadāna. Normally, when kings donate to recluses or any person they just order the workers to make the donation without them getting involved in it physically. If the donor is just instructing because he is not interested in involving in the act physically, then such donation deems to be low in its power to make results. Such donations are one of the asappurisa dānas called “asahatthā dānaṃ deti”. However, a vacīmayadāna will not have mentioned defects, if the donor has instructed someone to make a donation on behalf of himself due to being busy or being in a distant place. These days, vacīmayadānas are commonly seen when devotees who are living overseas make donations to monasteries.

#### **Sānusayasantānavato** (just describe why this term is important dāna to be kusala kamma?)
For a dāna to be a wholesome act (puññakiriyavatthu), the donation must be done by a person who has not eradicated all defilementssānusayasantānavato. However, a donation made by an Arahant still amounts to a dāna as mentioned in the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga Sutta – “Yo khīṇāsavo khīṇāsavassa dadāti dānaṃ”. Even in such a donation two factors of dāna are present: offering an existing requisite that belongs to oneself to someone else. Though an Arahant does not accumulate any merit by donating it is possible for others to rejoice on it and gain benefits. A petī, who was the mother of Venerable Sāriputta five lives ago rejoiced on the donations made by the latter and enjoyed various benefits. 13 (Story is given in Appendix).

#### **Kammasarikkatā** (what does this term means?)
In the law of kamma-vipāka (kamma and its results), the results correspond to the actions performed. This phenomenon, known as **kammasarikkhatā** (similarity of vipāka to its kamma), is evident in the results of actions. For example, when someone takes another person's life by beheading, it is highly likely that the perpetrator will face a similar fate of being beheaded in future existences as a consequence of their misdeed. Similarly, every act of dāna leads the donor (dāyaka) to accumulate wealth in the cycle of rebirth (saṃsāra) corresponding his praiseworthy act of supporting the receiver with requisites.

#### **Sakkaccaṃ**. (Explain the word with commentarial highlights)

Sakkaccaṃ dānaṃ deti – One performs dāna with respect.
There are two types of respect in this regard:
1. DeyyaDhamma sakkāra – respecting the things that are offered.
2. Dakkhiṇeyya sakkāra – respecting the beings to whom the deyyaDhamma are given.
Special benefit: By performing sakkacca dāna, in addition to accumulating wealth in saṃsāra, one develops a respectable personality. In future lives, their children, spouses, servants, and workers will respect their words, attentively listen, understand, and follow their advice – "Yepissa te honti puttāti vā dārāti vā dāsāti vā pessāti vā kammakarāti vā, tepi sussūsanti sotaṃ odahanti aññā cittaṃ upaṭṭhapenti."

Reasons for special benefits: The working of kamma and vipāka in this type of merit is easily understood – one who respects others will be respected in return as a vipāka – "sakkatvā sakkato hoti, garu hoti sagāravo."

#### **“Āgamanadiṭṭhiko dānaṃ deti”** how can Knowledge (paññā) intensify or upgrade the act of generosity while performing?

One who make donations with the understanding of kamma and vipāka is also referred with the sentence “āgamanadiṭṭhiko dānaṃ deti”. Such wholesome deed can also be called sampajānakata dāna. 29

The greater one's understanding of the results of dāna, the more potent their act of giving becomes. Here the term potent refers to the capacity of a kamma to yield great results. This is another fundamental related to dāna. 30 The idea has been illustrated in the commentary of the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga Sutta.
