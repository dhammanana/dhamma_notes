"...I saw a woman with a foul odor and and hideously ugly appearance, moving in the sky...."

**The cause:** this petī used to be a fortune-teller (ikkhaṇika) in Rājagaha city. In the commentary, "This woman performed yakkhadāsikamma, claiming 'through such a ritual, prosperity will come to you.' Deceiving people, she accepted scents and flowers. Furthermore, she **caused people to accept a wicked view, a wrong view**. Therefore, due to the residue effect of the kamma, she acquired a foul odor due to accepting scents and flowers and became ugly because of making people accept a wrong view."

yakkhadāsikamma:
1. sutta
2. sakka
3. rakkhasa
4. khīṇāsava
5. deva
